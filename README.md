A quick & dirty extensible Jackett-to-Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/Whatever indexer synchronizer written in Node.js. PRs are welcome!

## Install
### NPM
```
npm i -g jackett-sync
```
### Docker
An image is available at [`m00nwatcher/jackett-sync`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/m00nwatcher/jackett-sync)
## Usage

## Usenet support
Theoretically it should work, but as stated earlier untested

## TODO

- [] Add options to change indexer settings (min seeders etc.)
- Other stuff maybe
